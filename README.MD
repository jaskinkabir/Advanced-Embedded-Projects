This repo holds the project files for my Advanced Embedded Systems class at UNC Charlotte. I am currently taking this class over the Fall 2025 semester. The class explores advanced bare-metal programming and embedded systems architecture on the STM32-based Nucleo-F091RC Development Board.

# Projects
## [Project 1: Stack Frame Analysis](./cube/stackframedebug)
Intro to STM Cube IDE, the memory viewer, and function stack frames.
## [Project 2: GPIO and External Interrupts](./cube/gpio_exti)
GPIO configuration, external interrupts, debouncing, and PWM signal generation.
## [Project 3: SPI LCD Control](./cube/spi_lcd)
Interfacing with an LCD over SPI
